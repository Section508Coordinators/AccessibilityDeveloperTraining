# Alt Tag Best Practices

Alt tags are essential for making images accessible to screen readers and when images fail to load. Here are some key guidelines:

- Use empty alt tags (`alt=""`) for decorative images
- Don't use phrases like "Image of" or "Picture of" - screen readers already announce that it's an image
- Be concise but descriptive
- Focus on the purpose and content of the image

## Examples

### Decorative Image

When an image is purely decorative and doesn't convey meaningful content, use an empty alt tag:

<Story name="Examples" args={{ altType: 'decorative' }} />

```html
<img src="../assets/find-dhs-form.png" alt="" />
```

### Descriptive Image

When an image contains important information, provide a clear, concise description:

<Story name="Examples" args={{ altType: 'descriptive' }} />

```html
<img
  src="../assets/find-dhs-form.png"
  alt="Hand holding a pen writing on a printed piece of paper"
/>
```
